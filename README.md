# informed-citizen

this is a repo for a progressive web app centered around public office transparency

using public apis to collect and display information about the user's elected officials and their actions as public servants

each user will provide their home(voting) address and expect persistent sessions with relevant feeds from public officers that represent them

steps to complete:

#1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
identifying the specific government departments, agencies, or organizations that the application will focus on, as well as the types of information and data that will be made available to the public.

#2 GATHER DATA AND INFORMATION
gather data and information that will be used in the application. This includes information about government programs, services, budgets, and policies

#3 DESIGN INTERFACE
wireframes and mockups to illustrate how the application will look and function. It is important to keep the design simple and user-friendly to ensure that the public can easily access and understand the information

#4 DEVELOP AN APPLICATION
using APIs (ProPublica and Google Civic Info), generate the application with javascript react

#5 TEST THE APP
ask people to try it out and give us feedback

#6 LAUNCH APP (GO LIVE)
designate a server and database to generate live feed responsive interface

#7 MAINTAIN APP
monitor and update the application
